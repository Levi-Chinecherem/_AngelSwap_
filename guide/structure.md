### **Updated Project Structure Overview**

This updated structure includes components for implementing zk-proof security for all transactions, not just within the order book. Every transaction can be toggled for privacy, ensuring that the transaction is hashed and protected against front-running, back-running, sandwich attacks, and other types of malicious behavior.

---

#### **Project Root**

The root directory will contain all major project files, including configuration files, dependencies, and documentation.

```
project-root/
├── contracts/                # Smart contract files
├── frontend/                 # Frontend application
├── scripts/                  # Deployment and utility scripts
├── test/                     # Unit and integration tests
├── hardhat.config.js         # Hardhat configuration file
├── tailwind.config.js        # Tailwind CSS configuration
├── package.json              # Project dependencies
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
└── .env                      # Environment variables (e.g., private keys, API endpoints)
```

### **Smart Contracts**

The **`contracts/`** directory will house all of the smart contracts, including ERC-20 tokens, the liquidity pool, faucet, order book, limit order functionality, zk-proof security implementation, and their respective interfaces.

```
contracts/
├── AngelToken.sol            # ERC-20 token contract (for ANGEL token)
├── OtherToken.sol            # ERC-20 token contract (for dynamic tokens)
├── LiquidityPool.sol         # Liquidity pool contract (AMM model)
├── Faucet.sol                # Faucet contract for distributing test tokens
├── OrderBook.sol             # Order book contract with zk-proof integration
├── LimitOrder.sol            # Contract for handling limit orders (buy/sell orders at set prices)
├── Security.sol              # Contract for zk-proof privacy/security
├── interfaces/               # Interfaces for modular contracts
    ├── IERC20.sol
    ├── ILiquidityPool.sol
    ├── IOrderBook.sol
    ├── ILimitOrder.sol
    └── ISecurity.sol         # Interface for Security contract
```

- **`Security.sol`**: A new contract that handles zk-proof security. This contract will be responsible for protecting any transaction that has its privacy toggled on. It ensures that transactions are hashed and kept private from other users, including mempool, order book, and liquidity pool interactions. The contract will also handle the 5-second unhashing after a transaction is completed.

- **`AngelToken.sol`**, **`OtherToken.sol`**, **`LiquidityPool.sol`**, **`Faucet.sol`**, **`OrderBook.sol`**, and **`LimitOrder.sol`**: These contracts remain largely the same, but they will now interact with the `Security.sol` contract when a user toggles their privacy on.

---

### **Frontend**

The **frontend/** directory will include components for managing user transactions with zk-proof privacy and toggling security on or off. The frontend will allow users to toggle transaction security and interact with the system while keeping their transactions private.

```
frontend/
├── public/                   # Static files (e.g., images, icons)
├── src/                      # React.js source files
│   ├── components/           # Reusable React components
│   │   ├── Header.js
│   │   ├── Footer.js
│   │   ├── TradingInterface.js
│   │   ├── FaucetInterface.js
│   │   ├── OrderBook.js      # Displays current orders (limit orders, etc.)
│   │   ├── SecurityToggle.js # Component to toggle privacy/security on transactions
│   │   └── MempoolMonitor.js # Monitors pending transactions and transaction security
│   ├── context/              # Context API or Redux files for state management
│   │   ├── WalletProvider.js # Provides wallet context to app
│   │   ├── TokenContext.js   # Provides context for token info
│   │   ├── LiquidityContext.js # Provides context for liquidity info
│   │   └── SecurityContext.js  # Provides context for security-related actions
│   ├── hooks/                # Custom hooks for contract interactions
│   │   ├── useWallet.js      # Hook for wallet connection and interactions
│   │   ├── useLiquidity.js   # Hook for interacting with liquidity pool
│   │   ├── useSecurity.js    # Hook for interacting with security/privacy toggle
│   │   └── useFaucet.js      # Hook for interacting with faucet
│   ├── pages/                # Page components for routing
│   │   ├── Home.js
│   │   ├── Trade.js          # Page for token swapping and limit order management
│   │   ├── Faucet.js         # Page for claiming tokens from faucet
│   │   ├── Mempool.js        # Page for viewing pending transactions
│   │   └── Security.js       # Page for managing security preferences
│   ├── App.js                # Main App component
│   ├── index.js              # Entry point
│   └── styles/               # Tailwind CSS and custom styles
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── dark-theme.css
│       └── overrides.css
└── package.json              # Frontend dependencies (React, Ethers.js, etc.)
```

- **`SecurityToggle.js`**: This component allows users to toggle their transaction security. If a user turns on the security feature, all their transactions will be hashed and made private. If they turn it off, transactions will be open and not hashed.
- **`SecurityContext.js`**: Manages the state for transaction privacy and controls the toggling of the security feature for the entire app.

---

### **Deployment and Scripts**

The **scripts/** directory will contain updated deployment and utility scripts to manage the deployment of the new `Security.sol` contract, as well as managing privacy toggling during contract interactions.

```
scripts/
├── deploy.js                 # Deploys all contracts (AngelToken, LiquidityPool, Security, etc.)
├── deployAngelToken.js       # Deploys AngelToken contract
├── deployLiquidityPool.js    # Deploys LiquidityPool contract
├── deploySecurity.js         # Deploys Security contract
├── seedFaucet.js             # Seeds faucet with tokens for users
├── deployOtherTokens.js      # Dynamically deploys other tokens
├── interact.js               # Script for testing contract interactions
└── utils/                    # Helper scripts (e.g., ABI processing)
    ├── generateABIs.js
    └── helpers.js
```

- **`deploySecurity.js`**: This script deploys the **Security** contract, which will handle the zk-proof privacy toggling for transactions.
- **`deploy.js`**: Deploys all the contracts, including **Security.sol**, and initializes the necessary state for privacy protection.

---

### **Testing**

The **test/** directory will also be updated to include tests for the **Security.sol** contract and its interaction with other system components.

```
test/
├── AngelToken.test.js        # Tests for AngelToken contract
├── LiquidityPool.test.js     # Tests for LiquidityPool contract
├── Faucet.test.js            # Tests for Faucet contract
├── OrderBook.test.js         # Tests for OrderBook contract
├── LimitOrder.test.js        # Tests for LimitOrder contract
├── Security.test.js          # Tests for Security contract (zk-proof privacy toggling)
├── OtherToken.test.js        # Tests for OtherToken contract
└── utils/                    # Utility functions for testing
    └── setupTestEnv.js
```

- **`Security.test.js`**: Contains tests to ensure that the **Security.sol** contract is properly hashing transactions, toggling privacy, and unhashing transactions after the specified time.

---

### **Conclusion**

With these updates, the system will now support zk-proof privacy for all transactions, not just within the order book. Users can toggle privacy on or off, and transactions will be securely hashed and protected from malicious activities like front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks. The entire system will still function as expected, but with the added layer of security for users who opt-in for private transactions.
