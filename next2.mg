looking at all my contracts i want to be able to connect this contract from the frontend but alot of storing needs to be done
so i need you to help out on the integration of the contract with the frontend, i have static frontend codes that you will help me include the contracts on
i want you to use redux for the store management, i believe redux toolkit works well for that 
so what i'll do is ill share with you my contracts and my frontend codes for you to fix them all one after the other 

i will love to have and admin dashboard where i can do things like adding of tokens for the liquidity pool and the orderbook contracts
so let me know which approach would be better sharing all my contracts codes with you first before sharing the frontend or sharing the contracts along side the frontend it relates to???
