# Full System Overview

This decentralized platform allows users to trade tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX), with additional features such as limit orders, a liquidity pool, dynamic token creation, a faucet, an order book, and zk-proof security. Here's a detailed breakdown of each component and how they fit together in the overall system:

---

### **1. Token System (ERC-20 Tokens)**

The system revolves around the issuance and management of ERC-20 tokens. The primary token in the system is the **ANGEL** token, but the platform is designed to dynamically allow the creation of other tokens, which can be used in trading or staking.

- **ANGEL Token**: This is the primary token of the platform, representing the main asset for trading. It's deployed on the Ethereum-compatible blockchain (such as PulseChain in your case). Users can trade, stake, or use it for liquidity provision.
  
- **Other Tokens**: The system supports the dynamic creation of additional ERC-20 tokens through a template contract. These tokens can be created on-demand, giving flexibility for different projects or use cases. Users can interact with these tokens in the same way they do with the ANGEL token.

---

### **2. Limit Order and Order Book System**

A major feature of the system is the ability to place **limit orders**. Limit orders allow users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price, ensuring that they get their desired price rather than just executing market orders at the current price.

- **Limit Order Contract**: Users can create buy or sell orders with specific price and quantity conditions. The contract ensures that orders are only filled when the market price matches the user's specified limit price. If the order is not filled, it remains in the order book until the conditions are met or the user cancels the order.

- **Order Book**: This is a decentralized system that tracks all active orders (both limit and market orders). It allows users to view current market conditions and decide which orders they want to fulfill. This transparency adds liquidity and enables more structured trading.

---

### **3. Liquidity Pool (Automated Market Maker)**

A core component of the DEX is the **liquidity pool**, where users can provide liquidity by depositing tokens into a smart contract. This liquidity is then used for token swaps, where users can exchange one token for another.

- **Liquidity Providers**: Users can contribute tokens to the liquidity pool and, in return, receive a share of the pool's trading fees. This incentivizes users to participate in providing liquidity.
  
- **Token Swaps**: When a user wants to exchange one token for another, the DEX uses the liquidity pool to execute the trade. It functions similarly to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or SushiSwap. The price for swaps is determined by the ratio of tokens in the pool.

---

### **4. Faucet**

The **faucet** is designed to allow users to claim a certain number of tokens for free, typically for testing purposes or as part of a promotional offering.

- **Faucet Contract**: This contract distributes small amounts of tokens to users. For example, new users or testers can claim tokens to interact with the platform, explore the DEX, and participate in token swaps, liquidity provision, or other activities without needing to first purchase tokens.

- **Token Distribution**: The faucet is seeded with tokens and provides them to users who meet specific conditions. For instance, users might need to connect their wallets or verify their identity before claiming tokens.

---

### **5. User Interaction and Trading Interface**

The frontend of the platform provides users with an intuitive interface for interacting with all the features of the system, including token trading, viewing the order book, placing limit orders, and claiming tokens from the faucet.

- **Trading Interface**: This is where users can execute token swaps, view current liquidity pools, and see active orders (market or limit). The platform could feature charts, trade history, and other tools to help users make informed decisions.
  
- **Limit Order Form**: A user-friendly form where users can place limit orders, specifying the token, quantity, and price at which they are willing to buy or sell. This provides more control over trade execution.

- **Faucet Interface**: Allows users to claim tokens from the faucet, providing a seamless experience for new users to start using the platform without the need for an initial investment.

---

### **6. Backend and Smart Contracts**

The smart contracts are the backbone of the platform, ensuring trustless execution of transactions and the secure management of tokens, liquidity pools, limit orders, and the faucet.

- **ERC-20 Tokens**: All tokens (ANGEL and others) are managed by smart contracts that adhere to the ERC-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with most decentralized applications (dApps).
  
- **Liquidity Pool Contract**: Implements the Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) functionality, enabling token swaps and liquidity provision. Liquidity providers can deposit tokens into the pool and earn a share of the fees generated by trades.

- **Order Book Contract**: Tracks buy and sell orders, ensuring that users can place and view orders before they are filled. This contract also facilitates the execution of limit orders when market prices match the set limits.

- **Limit Order Contract**: Manages user-defined buy and sell orders at specific price points. This contract is crucial for providing more advanced trading options beyond basic market orders, offering users the ability to automate trades based on price movements.

- **Faucet Contract**: Distributes tokens to users based on pre-defined conditions. It helps onboard new users or provides tokens for testing purposes.

### **7. zk-Proof Security**

A major update to the system is the integration of **zk-proof security**, which provides enhanced privacy and protection for all transactions on the platform.

- **Privacy Toggle**: Users can choose to toggle their transaction privacy on or off. When enabled, all transactions are hashed and encrypted, ensuring they are kept private and secure from other users, including the mempool, order book, and liquidity pool. This prevents front-running, back-running, sandwich attacks, and other malicious activities.
  
- **Transaction Hashing**: When privacy is enabled, the details of the transaction (such as the order or swap) are hidden from the public and the system. The transaction is processed securely in the background, ensuring only the user and the contract know the transaction details.
  
- **Unhashing**: After 5 seconds, once the transaction has been fulfilled, it will be unhashed and made visible to others. This ensures that there is no permanent exposure of sensitive transaction data but allows transparency once the trade is completed.
  
- **zk-Security Contract**: The **Security.sol** contract is responsible for the zk-proof implementation. It ensures that transactions can be processed privately, preventing malicious users from exploiting the system.

### **8. Deployment and Utility Scripts**

To facilitate the development and maintenance of the platform, several scripts are used for contract deployment, token seeding, and interactions.

- **Deployment Scripts**: These scripts deploy all the smart contracts to the blockchain, including the deployment of the AngelToken, LiquidityPool, and LimitOrder contracts. Scripts can also be used to deploy additional tokens dynamically as needed.

- **Seeding Scripts**: These are used to seed the faucet with tokens or provide liquidity to the liquidity pool. This ensures that users can interact with the platform even before initial liquidity is provided by external sources.

- **Utility Scripts**: Helper scripts assist with tasks such as processing ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) or interacting with deployed contracts for testing and maintenance purposes.

### **9. Testing and Quality Assurance**

Testing is essential to ensure the platform functions correctly and securely. The system includes automated tests for each contract and integration tests to ensure the overall platform works as expected.

- **Unit Tests**: Each smart contract (such as `AngelToken`, `LiquidityPool`, `OrderBook`, etc.) has dedicated unit tests to verify their individual functionality.
  
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that ensure the different contracts interact properly. For example, testing the entire flow of adding liquidity to a pool, placing an order, executing a trade, and interacting with the faucet.

---

### **10. Decentralization and Security**

The platform relies on decentralized principles for trustless execution and transparency:

- **Smart Contracts**: The entire platform is powered by smart contracts, ensuring that no central authority is needed for transactions or order matching.
  
- **zk-Security**: The **Security.sol** contract implements zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) for added privacy and security, ensuring that sensitive data (like order details) is protected from front-running, back-running, and other types of attacks.

- **Token Standards**: By using ERC-20 tokens and adhering to standard practices, the platform ensures compatibility with existing wallets and exchanges.
